### Step 2
Get this repository working on your local environment to start fixing issues

### Step 3
There is an issue with the rendering of the website. Please fix the issue so that it renders the CSS properly. Minified css is preferred.

### Step 4
The header area of the website that has a background image is too short. We need to make it bigger and higher. Please make it higher. We think it should be at least 400px high.

### Step 5
The content area of the website on desktop and tablet layouts is too wide. If goes all the way across the screen making it very hard to read. Please decrease the content column width to 8 columns wide on desktop and centre the column.

Please make it 10 columns on tablet layout and centre the content.


### Step 6
Make all headings and body copy use fluid text resize.

Additional Step if Required: WordPress Developer
Please contact us before continuing at this point.

If you’re wanting to be a WordPress Developer with us, at this point you will need to convert the theme into a working WordPress blog with the wp posts feeding onto the homepage. Record a screenshare of it and talk us through your code and your theme structure.


commit the wordpress site with database export included.

We estimate it will take 1-2 hours. Commit logs are also required as you build the theme/template to see how you progress through the build.
